# Welocme to [smiley-practice](https://github.com/gerveloper/smiley-practice#smiley-practice)!

> HTML, CSS &amp; JS short practice (beginner)

In this short practice I tried to play around a little bit with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**. It’s simply a face that will change its mood according to user input. The name is *Smiley… Captain Smiley*, actually (based on a DS9 character from the alternate universe).


## What I worked with:

 - **HTML** to define the divs in order to create the face and the surprise element; 
 - **CSS** to shape and colour the divs, as well as to ‘cut’ diagonally the div of the surprise element;
 - **JS** to program the commands using an addEventListener that calls a function based on the switch statement.


## Commands are just really basic:

**Arrow Up**: Smile, Smiley!

**Arrow Down**: Oh, no, what have I done?! Don’t cry, Smiley.

**Any other key**: Oh, Smiley is appalled. Again!

**Space**: Smiley contemplates the vast vacuum of space and resets.

**V**: turns on and off a little surprise for all Star Trek fans.
